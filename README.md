# ngrok-Azure-Function

Basic Azure HTTP Function that will log the message sent by GitHub Webhook to the console. Used for demonstrating [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and [GitHub Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks) for a blog post on my website - found [here](https://www.philbroderick.net/blog/making-localhost-publicly-available-with-ngrok).
